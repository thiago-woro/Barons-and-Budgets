/*
Function: updateHoveredCell

- Changed mouse coordinate calculations to use event.offsetX and event.offsetY instead of computing from getBoundingClientRect. This provided accurate relative mouse positions despite CSS transforms.

- Converted the relative screen coordinates to world coordinates by dividing by zoom and adding the camera's position.

- Calculated the cell index by applying Math.floor to the world coordinates divided by cellSize.

- Computed the screen cell position using the cell index, camera position, and current zoom level to correctly draw the highlight.

- Added console logs using template literals to log key values for debugging in the function.
