keep in mind that this is a 2d game, stack is html, css and javascript only. it uses html canvas and a cell grid to create a game map. 

let zoomLevel = 1.0;
let canvasX = 0;
let canvasY = 0;
let mouseX = 0;
let mouseY = 0;
let cameraX = 0;
let cameraY = 0;


cameraX = (gridSize * cellSize) / 2;
cameraY = (gridSize * cellSize) / 2;
