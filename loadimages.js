/* If you want to structure your code to manage NPC images based on their professions, you can create an image mapping object where each profession is associated with the corresponding image URL. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create an Image Mapping Object:**

   Define an object that maps each profession to its corresponding image URL. This object should be placed at the beginning of your JavaScript file or in a separate module:
 */
 
   const professionImages = {
       "Jester": "jester.png",
       "Innkeeper": "innkeeper.png",
       "Tailor": "tailor.png",
       // Add more professions and image URLs as needed
   };



/* 
   In this object, each profession (e.g., "Jester", "Innkeeper", "Tailor") is associated with the filename of the image for that profession.

2. **Update the NPC Class Constructor:**

   Modify the `NPC` class constructor to include a property for the image URL based on the NPC's profession:

 */
   
   class NPC {
       constructor(x, y, myNumber, parents, age) {
           // ... Other constructor code ...

           // Add a property to store the image URL based on profession
           this.imageURL = professionImages[this.profession] || "default.png";
       }

       // ... Rest of the NPC class ...
   }






/* 
   Here, we use the `professionImages` object to retrieve the image URL based on the NPC's `this.profession`. If the profession is not found in the object, it defaults to "default.png" (you can change this to any default image you prefer).

3. **Rendering NPCs with Images:**

   When rendering NPCs on the game canvas, use the `this.imageURL` property to set the `src` attribute of the `Image` element:

 */





   // Function to render NPCs on the game canvas
   function renderNPCs(npcs) {
       const gameCanvas = document.getElementById("gameCanvas");
       npcs.forEach((npc) => {
           const npcImage = new Image();
           npcImage.src = npc.imageURL; // Set the image source
           gameCanvas.appendChild(npcImage);
       });
   }
/*    ```

   Now, when you create NPC objects, their `this.imageURL` property will be automatically set based on their profession, and you can render them with the appropriate images.

With this structure, you can easily manage NPC images based on their professions, and it provides a clean separation between NPC attributes and image handling. You can expand the `professionImages` object and update it with more professions and image URLs as needed. */
