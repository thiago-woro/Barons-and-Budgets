  "Jester": [
    "Why did the Purry jester bring a ladder to the tavern? Because they heard the drinks were on the house!"
  ],
  "Innkeeper": [
    "Welcome to my inn! Our beds are as comfy as a Purry curled up in a sunbeam."
  ],
  "Tailor": [
    "I make clothes for Purries, but they always end up covered in fur anyway. Fashion is futile!"
  ],
  "Knight": [
    "I'm a Purry knight! My sword may be tiny, but my heart is as fierce as a lion!"
  ],
  "Archer": [
    "I shoot arrows straighter than a Purry pouncing on a mouse! Well, most of the time..."
  ],
  "Ranger": [
    "The forest is my home. I once tracked a squirrel for three days. It was the most epic battle of my life!"
  ],
  "Chef": [
    "Cooking for Purries is a breeze. Just throw anything edible on a plate and watch them purr in delight!"
  ],
  "Cook": [
    "I'm the sous chef. My specialty? Burnt fish. Every time."
  ],
  "Bard": [
    "I'm a Purry bard, and my songs are so enchanting, even the mice can't resist dancing!"
  ],
  "Drunk": [
    "Another round, please! I may have nine lives, but I'm determined to drink them all tonight!"
  ],
  "Researcher": [
    "I'm conducting groundbreaking research on the best way to nap. So far, the 'sunbeam technique' is winning."
  ],
  "Poet": [
    "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm a Purry poet, and I'm napping with you!"
  ],
  "Scientist": [
    "I'm on the verge of discovering the purr-fect formula for endless treats. Science, it's a noble pursuit!"
  ],
  "Tinkerer": [
    "I build contraptions that no one understands, not even me. But they make great cat toys!"
  ],
  "Miner": [
    "Digging for treasure in dark tunnels? That's a job for someone with more than one life. I prefer sunny spots."
  ],
  "novice": ["I'm too young and catful for this."]
