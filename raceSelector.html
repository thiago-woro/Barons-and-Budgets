        <h2 class="race-title">Purries</h2>
        <p class="race-description">Purries are gluttons. Bards, artists, and drunks. They love to gamble, some are good chefs, poets. They have the shortest lifespan, maybe that's why they don't have a slave race to help them mine.</p>

    <div class="race-card">
        <img src="kurohi-image.jpg" alt="Kurohi Image" class="race-image">
        <h2 class="race-title">Kurohi (Dark Magicians)</h2>
        <p class="race-description">They say Kurohi wear robes to protect their skin, which has a burned, ashy-like appearance. They are mostly evil and corrupted and strangely have customs and professions of a long-extinct race, "humans." They mostly don't mine and use Zombies as mining slaves.</p>

    <div class="race-card">
        <img src="elf-image.jpg" alt="Elf Image" class="race-image">
        <h2 class="race-title">Elves</h2>
        <p class="race-description">On the outside, the Elven civilization looks like the most technologically advanced. They have a strong caste system that favors the rich and makes sure the labor force stays poor. Besides that, they also created slave bots.</p>
